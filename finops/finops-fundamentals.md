# FinOps

## Section 1 - Cloud Computing Fundamentals 

### Five essential characteristics, three service modesl, four deployment models

Characteristics:

- On demand self-service
- Broad network access
- Resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity
- Measured service

Service Models:
- Software as a Service (SaaS) - for users (Salesforce)
- Platform as a Servie (PaaS) - for developers (GCP App Engine)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - for operations (EC2)

Deployment Models (how we use cloud):
- Private
- Hybrid
- Community
- Public

### On-prem vs Cloud

- Localization of the cost management (from central management to developers - more waste)
- Material spend: not possible to predict the cost of infrastructure
- Variable price: spend what you use. ("Every minute counts") 

### Cloud Challenges

- Security
- Performance
- Connectivity
- Billing

## Section 2 - FinOps Fundamentals 

FinOps is an evolving cloud financial management discipline and cultural practice that enables organizations to get maximum business value by helping engineering, finance, technology and business teams to collaborate on data-driven spending decisions.

- An effecient way to teams manage their cloud costs
- Ownership driven and supported by a central group
- Work towards to financial and operational control
- A way prioritize cloud costs optimization

FinOps is about ROI (profit)


Why FinOps:

- Control spending (control & optimize)
- Set best practices


1. Tagging
2. Optimize
3. Forecast consuption

FinOps appeared because people did not learnead to mamage cloud costs. So FinOps is a try of managing costs has on-prem resources style with budgeting approval.

### FinOps Principles
- Collaboration
- Business value
- Ownership
- Timely reports
- Centralized team
- Variable cost model

### FinOps Lifecycle
1. Inform (Visibility and allocation)
2. Optimize (Utilization)
3. Operate
4. (Repete)



## CAPEX and OPEX

- Capital Expenditures (long term investioment) (ownership of assets)
- Operational Expenditures (day to day costs) (paying for services)


## ROI and TOC

ROI: Return On Investiment (profit)

TCO: Total Cost Onwership - total cost of cloud technology
