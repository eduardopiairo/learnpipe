# FinOps

## Cloud Computing Fundamentals 

### Five essential characteristics, three service modesl, four deployment models

Characteristics:

- On demand self-service
- Broad network access
- Resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity
- Measured service

Service Models:
- Software as a Service (SaaS) - for users (Salesforce)
- Platform as a Servie (PaaS) - for developers (GCP App Engine)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - for operations (EC2)

Deployment Models (how we use cloud):
- Private
- Hybrid
- Community
- Public

### On-prem vs Cloud

- Localization of the cost management (from central management to developers - more waste)
- Material spend: not possible to predict the cost of infrastructure
- Variable price: spend what you use. ("Every minute counts") 

### Cloud Challenges

- Security
- Performance
- Connectivity
- Billing

## FinOps Fundamentals 

FinOps is an evolving cloud financial management discipline and cultural practice that enables organizations to get maximum business value by helping engineering, finance, technology and business teams to collaborate on data-driven spending decisions.

- An efficient way to teams manage their cloud costs
- Ownership driven and supported by a central group
- Work towards to financial and operational control
- A way prioritize cloud costs optimization

FinOps is about ROI (profit)


Why FinOps:

- Control spending (control & optimize)
- Set best practices


1. Tagging
2. Optimize
3. Forecast consuption

FinOps appeared because people did not learnead to mamage cloud costs. So FinOps is a try of managing costs has on-prem resources style with budgeting approval.

### FinOps Principles
- Collaboration
- Business value
- Ownership
- Timely reports
- Centralized team
- Variable cost model

### FinOps Lifecycle
1. Inform (Visibility and allocation)
2. Optimize (Utilization)
3. Operate
4. (Repete)


## CAPEX and OPEX

- Capital Expenditures (long term investioment) (ownership of assets)
- Operational Expenditures (day to day costs) (paying for services)


## ROI and TOC

ROI: Return On Investiment (profit)

TCO: Total Cost Onwership - total cost of cloud technology


## Chargeback

- Is a policy of allocating resource usage costs to actual business units.
- Is a common method to avoid overspending.
- Provides visibility and accountability for resource spending (what was spent and who spent).
- Accounting model.
- Tagging (and other metadata) implementation


## FinOps Team

Should be responsible for:
- Defining enterprise cloud usage strategy;
- Definig and adjusting enterprise cloud budgets
- Setting up the cloud usage practices and guidelines
- Reviewing the data and determining corrective actions as needed.


Cloud costs should be visible to evryone => Showback

Establishing a team by identifying specific members from:
- Cloud Center of Excellence
- Sponsor(s)
- Engineering
- Finance
- Application owners
- DevOps
- And other business units

### Team Roles (= Personas)
- FinOps Practitioner
- Financial Controller
- Cloud Practitioners
- Executives
- Engineers


### Centralized FinOps Team
- Increases collaboration
- Increase culture
- Removes duplication of efforts
- Streamlines planning and decisions
- Removes bias and reduce disagreements
- Alignment with business goals

The level of centralization needs to be adapted to the organization.

### Organization Changes and adoption

1. Executive buy-in
2. Obtaining funding to establish a FinOps practice (people, training and tools)
3. assigning responsible members (key personas) to drive adoption

### Motivations

- FinOps practitioners must build reporting and processes that reduce the need for both finance and engineering teams (efficiency);
- Common language enables teams to familiarize themselves with a common set of terms that we understand (remove barriers);
- Every FinOps stakeholder will have specific motivations.


### FinOps Triangle
- Quality
- Speed
- Cost



## FinOps Capabilities
- FinOps domains represents a sphere of activity or knowledge;
- Each FinOps domain consists of FinOps capabilities;
- Capabilities are "functional activities" to meet the demands of a FinOps practice/domain.

### Domains
- Understand cloud usage & cost
- Performance tracking & benchmarking
- Real-time decision making
- Cloud rate optimization
- Cloud usage optimization
- Organizational alignment
