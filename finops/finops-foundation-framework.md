## FinOps Domains
FinOps domains represents a sphere of activity or knowledge. Each domain consists of FinOps capabilities. Capabilities outline functional activities that can be performed as part of that domain.

- A set of capabilities.
- Provide a high level overview of what functional activities are needed to run a FinOps practice.

The domains are:
- Understanding cloud usage and cost
- Performance traking & benchmarking
- Real-time decision making
- Cloud rate optimization
- Cloud usage optimization
- Organizational alignment


### Understanding cloud usage and cost
Within this domain, the organization will work to gather all required information about its cloud usage and cost, normalize it, make it available for review.

This domain enables an organization to understand what cloud services it’s using, what is driving spend, and who owns that spending.

*This domain answers the question: What are we spending on cloud and what are we using?*

The capabilities within this domain focus on understanding and allocating the cost and usage within the organization, and not on actioning it for a particular purpose:
- Measuring unit costs
- Managing shared costs
- Managing anomalies
- Forecasting
- Data ingestion & normalization
- Cost allocation (meatadata and hierarchy)
- Data analysis and showback


### Performance traking & benchmarking
Within this domain, the organization sets and maps its usage and cost to budgets, uses historical information to forecast, and establishes and measures KPIs and other performance indicators, including benchmarking.

*This domain answers the question: Does what we’re using/spending allow us to achieve our strategic and organizational objectives?*

This domain entails the capabilities that look at the past and current spend, set baselines and budgets, and then forecast:
- Resource utilization & efficiency
- Measuring unit costs
- Managing commitment based discounts
- Managing anomalies
- Forecasting
- Budget management


### Real-time decision making
When we understand what we are spending, and understand how we are performing relative to expectations and standards, we can then use that information to make real-time decisions as we receive new information.

The goal here is not to specifically strive for real-time data in and of itself, but to leverage timely access to consistent cost & usage data for making continuous adjustments.

*This domain answers the question: What actions can I take now to allow me to better meet my organizational goals and objectives?*

The capabilities for this domain are:
- Measuring unit costs
- Managing anomalies
- Establishing a FinOps decision and accountability structure
- Data analysis and showback


### Cloud rate optimization
Within this domain, the organization works to define its pricing model goals, uses historical data to make pricing model adjustments by buying commitment based discounts, and works to manage the pricing aspects of services it is using in the cloud.

*This domain answers the question: How can we change what we’re paying and how we’re buying what we use in the cloud to achieve better price performance?*

This domain will contain the specialized capabilities to improve the manner in which we purchase cloud services, and ensure our pricing models, purchase options, and committed use are consistent with our goals:
- Intersection of cloud FinOps and sustainability
- Managing commitment based discounts
- Data analysis and showback


### Cloud usage optimization
Within this domain, the organization identifies and takes action to match running cloud resources to the actual demand of the workloads running at any given time (rightsizing,turn-off, delete resources). 

*This domain answers the question: How can we change what we’re using and when we’re using it in the cloud to better meet our organizational goals?*

This domain contains the set of capabilities to use the right resources, in the right size, only when we need them to produce business value:
- Intersection of cloud FinOps and sustainability
- Workload management and automation
- Resource utilization and efficiency
- Onboarding workloads
- Data analysis and showback


### Organizational alignment
Within this domain, the organization acts and automates to manage cloud use within the context of other IT Finance activities, and integrates FinOps capabilities with existing organizational processes, organizational units, and technology.

*This domain answers the question: What changes can I make within my organization to use cloud more effectively?*

This domain contains the capabilities we’ll use to continuously improve, to change and align our organization itself – its people, processes and technology:
- Cloud policy and governance
- Managing shared costs
- Managing commitment based discounts
- Establising FinOps culture
- FinOps education and enablement
- Establising a FinOps decision and accountability structure
- Chargeback and finance integration
- Budget management
- FinOps and intersecting frameworks (ITSM, ITFM/TBM, ITAM/SAM, Security, Sustainability)
