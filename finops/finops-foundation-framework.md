## FinOps Domains
FinOps domains represents a sphere of activity or knowledge. Each domain consists of FinOps capabilities. Capabilities outline functional activities that can be performed as part of that domain.

- A set of capabilities.
- Provide a high level overview of what functional activities are needed to run a FinOps practice.

The domains are:
- Understanding cloud usage and cost
- Performance traking & benchmarking
- Real-time decision making
- Cloud rate optimization
- Cloud usage optimization
- Organizational alignment


### Understanding cloud usage and cost
Within this domain, the organization will work to gather all required information about its cloud usage and cost, normalize it, make it available for review.

This domain enables an organization to understand what cloud services itâ€™s using, what is driving spend, and who owns that spending.

*This Domain answers the question: What are we spending on cloud and what are we using?*

The Capabilities within this domain focus on understanding and allocating the cost and usage within the organization, and not on actioning it for a particular purpose:
- Measuring unit costs
- Managing shared costs
- Managing anomalies
- Forecasting
- Data ingestion & normalization
- Cost allocation (meatadata and hierarchy)
- Data analysis and showback

### Performance traking & benchmarking
